# picoCTF secret message challenge
In this challenge a message was sent over a netwrork but the 
message was encoded in ASCII characters.
The message is in the SecretMessage.txt file in case you want to 
view it.

To solve this challenge, I spent three days(since I'm a beginner) 
trying to write a python script that decodes the message.

Script: *decoder.py*
The script takes the file name with its extension as an argument.

To use it execute the code below, if only you have the script
and the SecretMessage file already downloaded.

```
python decoder.py Your_Encoded_Text_File
```
